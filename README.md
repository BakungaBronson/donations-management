## Problem (SDG Relevant)
Currently there are a number of people in need of help in third world countries where poverty is most prevailant. A number of organisations claim to distribute donations to people but do not and forge documents about the actual amount they gave out. Our project aims to use blockchain technology to receive donations and send them out to verified users at once when the time for donations closes thereby ensuring that users get the help they need.
